# How to run Jupyter Notebook on Windows
After installing Jupyter Notebook with pip you might not have the command to execute Jupyter Notebook like everyone else. It is not that you are different, but instead chosen to travel a much more difficult interesting path. It is not impossible. It is actually just as easy as typing in the following in your cmd (command prompt) on windows.

```shell
py -m notebook # you might need replace py with either python or python3
```

There you go! it should prompt you with a token that you will need to copy and paste into a url. Also copying and pasting in the cmd can be quite tidious. Try this guide: http://www.onlinecmag.com/enable-copy-and-paste-feature-cmd/
